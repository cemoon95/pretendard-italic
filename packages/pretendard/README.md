<p>It's an italic version of <a href="https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard">Pretendard</a>...
<br>...or so I would like to call it, but to be honest, it's just tilted 10 degrees indiscriminately without much mind to anything else.
<br>Since Pretendard was made with an emphasis on grotesque stylization, I didn't like the idea of just borrowing Inter's italics or whatnot, so I decided to manually tilt it so that it would work properly on web browsers when using it on websites.</p>

<p>I largely made it for my own purposes, so only .woff and .woff2 files were created for it.
<br>But hey, if it's useful for anyone else.</p>
