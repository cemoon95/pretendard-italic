<p>It's an italic version of <a href="https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard">Pretendard</a>...
<br>...or so I would like to call it, but to be honest, it's just tilted 10 degrees indiscriminately without much mind to anything else.
<br>Since Pretendard was made with an emphasis on grotesque stylization, I didn't like the idea of just borrowing Inter's italics or whatnot, but most web browers and word processors etc. are likely to tilt it an excessive 12 degrees or more, so I decided to manually tilt it so that it would behave more like a proper italic font.</p>

<p>I largely made it for my own purposes, so the .woff and .woff2 variants are based off the original variable .ttf version, meaning that they aren't properly divided into subsets. I may make a better version for web optimization sometime in the future.
<br>But hey, if it's useful for anyone else.</p>

<p>As of this writing, the font is made to pair with <a href="https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard/releases/tag/v1.3.9">Pretendard v1.3.9.</a></p>
