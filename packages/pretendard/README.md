It's an italic version of <a href="https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard">Pretendard</a>...
...or so I would like to call it, but to be honest, it's just tilted 10 degrees indiscriminately without much mind to anything else.
Since Pretendard was made with an emphasis on grotesque stylization, I didn't like the idea of just borrowing Inter's italics or whatnot, so I decided to manually tilt it so that it would work properly on web browsers when using it on websites.

I largely made it for my own purposes, so only .woff and .woff2 files were created for it.
But hey, if it's useful for anyone else.
